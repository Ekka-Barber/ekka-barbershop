## New Salary Payment Confirmation & History System

**Objective:** Implement a new system where a single, comprehensive record of an employee's fully calculated salary components for a specific month is stored upon user confirmation. This record will be the source of truth for the new "Salary History" tab.

**Assumption:** All salary calculations (base, sales, commission, total bonuses, total deductions, total loans, net pay) are finalized in the frontend (likely within the `EmployeeSalary` objects managed by `useSalaryData`) before the confirmation step. This new table will store a snapshot of these frontend-calculated values.

### Phase 1: Database Design & Setup

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING: DO NOT MODIFY ANY SALARY CALCULATION LOGIC** 
> This phase only involves database schema changes with no impact on how salaries are calculated.

#### Sub-Task 1.1.1: Design `employee_monthly_salary` Table (100% Complete)
*   **Purpose:** This table will store a complete snapshot of all calculated salary components for an employee for a specific month, as confirmed from the frontend.
*   **Decisions Made:**
    *   Table name changed from `employee_monthly_salary_snapshots` to `employee_monthly_salary` for brevity.
    *   The `confirmed_by_user_id` column was removed as the application is used by a single admin.
*   **Considerations (Original):**
    *   Add `currency` column if multi-currency support is anticipated in the future. (Retained as optional)
    *   Consider `employee_role_snapshot` or `employee_department_snapshot` for historical reporting needs. (Retained as optional)
    *   A `status` column (e.g., 'confirmed', 'pending_correction') could be added if a more complex workflow is needed beyond simple confirmation. (Not implemented)
*   **SQL Script for New Table (as implemented):**
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE public.employee_monthly_salary (
        id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
        employee_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.employees(id) ON DELETE RESTRICT,
        employee_name_snapshot TEXT NOT NULL, -- Name of the employee at the time of confirmation
        -- employee_role_snapshot TEXT, -- Optional: Role of the employee at the time of confirmation
        month_year TEXT NOT NULL, -- Format "YYYY-MM", e.g., "2023-12"
        payment_confirmation_date DATE NOT NULL, -- Date the payment was confirmed by the user
        
        base_salary NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.00,
        sales_amount NUMERIC(10, 2) DEFAULT 0.00,
        commission_amount NUMERIC(10, 2) DEFAULT 0.00,
        total_bonuses NUMERIC(10, 2) DEFAULT 0.00,    -- Sum of all bonuses for the period
        total_deductions NUMERIC(10, 2) DEFAULT 0.00, -- Sum of all deductions for the period
        total_loan_repayments NUMERIC(10, 2) DEFAULT 0.00, -- Sum of all loan repayments for the period
        net_salary_paid NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL, -- The final net amount confirmed/paid
        -- currency TEXT DEFAULT 'USD', -- Optional: Add if multi-currency is a possibility

        salary_plan_id_snapshot uuid REFERENCES public.salary_plans(id) ON DELETE SET NULL, -- Salary plan ID at confirmation
        salary_plan_name_snapshot TEXT, -- Salary plan name at confirmation
        
        calculation_details_json JSONB, -- Optional: Store the frontend EmployeeSalary object or similar for detailed audit
        
        created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
        updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),

        CONSTRAINT month_year_format CHECK (month_year ~ '^\d{4}-(0[1-9]|1[0-2])$') -- Ensures YYYY-MM format
    );

    COMMENT ON TABLE public.employee_monthly_salary IS 'Stores a snapshot of all calculated salary components for an employee for a specific month, confirmed from the frontend.';
    COMMENT ON COLUMN public.employee_monthly_salary.month_year IS 'Pay period in YYYY-MM format. Enforced by a CHECK constraint.';
    COMMENT ON COLUMN public.employee_monthly_salary.employee_name_snapshot IS 'Name of the employee at the time of salary confirmation';
    COMMENT ON COLUMN public.employee_monthly_salary.payment_confirmation_date IS 'Date the payment was confirmed by the user in the dialog';
    COMMENT ON COLUMN public.employee_monthly_salary.total_bonuses IS 'Sum of all bonuses for the employee for this month_year';
    COMMENT ON COLUMN public.employee_monthly_salary.total_deductions IS 'Sum of all deductions for the employee for this month_year';
    COMMENT ON COLUMN public.employee_monthly_salary.total_loan_repayments IS 'Sum of all loan repayments for the employee for this month_year';
    COMMENT ON COLUMN public.employee_monthly_salary.net_salary_paid IS 'The final net salary amount that was paid/confirmed';
    COMMENT ON COLUMN public.employee_monthly_salary.salary_plan_id_snapshot IS 'Snapshot of the employee's salary_plan_id at the time of confirmation';
    COMMENT ON COLUMN public.employee_monthly_salary.salary_plan_name_snapshot IS 'Snapshot of the employee's salary_plan_name at the time of confirmation';
    COMMENT ON COLUMN public.employee_monthly_salary.calculation_details_json IS 'Optional: JSON representation of the full frontend salary calculation object for audit purposes';
    -- COMMENT ON COLUMN public.employee_monthly_salary.currency IS 'Currency code for the amounts, e.g., USD, EUR';
    -- COMMENT ON COLUMN public.employee_monthly_salary.employee_role_snapshot IS 'Optional: Role of the employee at the time of confirmation';
    ```

> üìù **After Completion:** Update the plan to mark this sub-task as complete and update the overall progress. (Completed)

#### Sub-Task 1.1.2: Create Indexes for `employee_monthly_salary` (100% Complete)
*   **SQL Script for Indexes (as implemented):**
    ```sql
    -- Index for common lookups
    CREATE INDEX idx_ems_employee_month ON public.employee_monthly_salary(employee_id, month_year);
    CREATE INDEX idx_ems_month_year ON public.employee_monthly_salary(month_year);
    CREATE INDEX idx_ems_payment_confirmation_date ON public.employee_monthly_salary(payment_confirmation_date);
    -- Note: Index for confirmed_by_user_id was removed as the column was removed.
    -- CREATE INDEX idx_ems_salary_plan_id_snapshot ON public.employee_monthly_salary(salary_plan_id_snapshot); -- Optional: If filtering by salary plan snapshot is common
    ```

> üìù **After Completion:** Update the plan to mark this sub-task as complete and update the overall progress. (Completed)

#### Sub-Task 1.1.3: Define RLS for `employee_monthly_salary` (100% Complete)
*   **Guidance:** Start with a simple policy for authenticated users (if this is an admin-only panel) or a specific admin `user_id`. Refine based on actual roles and access needs (e.g., HR, managers).
*   **Decision Made:** As the application is used by a single admin (the authenticated user), a policy granting full access to any authenticated user was implemented.
*   **SQL Script for RLS Policy (as implemented):**
    ```sql
    -- Enable RLS
    ALTER TABLE public.employee_monthly_salary ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

    -- Policy allowing any authenticated user full access
    CREATE POLICY "Allow full access for authenticated users"
    ON public.employee_monthly_salary
    FOR ALL -- This applies to SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
    TO authenticated
    USING (true) -- Allows all rows to be visible/queried
    WITH CHECK (true); -- Allows all inserts/updates
    ```
    *It's crucial to implement appropriate RLS. The "Allow ALL for authenticated" is a placeholder for development and must be secured.* (Note: This warning is less critical in a single-user scenario but retained for good practice).

> üìù **After Completion:** Update the plan to mark this sub-task as complete and update the overall progress. (Completed)

#### Sub-Task 1.1.4: Handle Existing `salary_history` Table (100% Complete)
*   **Action:** The existing `salary_history` table was replaced by `employee_monthly_salary`.
*   **Decision Made:** The table `public.salary_history` was dropped using `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.salary_history CASCADE;`. This ensures all dependent objects like triggers, indexes, and foreign key constraints were also removed.
*   **SQL Script (as executed):**
    *   `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.salary_history CASCADE;`
*   **Note:** This action is irreversible. Data backup prior to dropping was advised if historical data was needed.

> üìù **After Completion:** Update the plan to mark this sub-task as complete and update the overall progress. (Completed)

#### Sub-Task 1.1.5: Review `EmployeeSalary` Type (Frontend) (100% Complete)
*   **Action:** Reviewed the `EmployeeSalary` TypeScript type definition from `src/components/admin/employee-management/salary/hooks/utils/salaryTypes.ts`.
*   **Objective:** Ensured it comprehensively includes all individual components that make up totals OR that the existing total fields are accurately calculated from all underlying sources in the frontend.
*   **Rationale:** This ensures the `calculation_details_json` snapshot is complete and the summarized figures stored directly in the table are correct and auditable.
*   **Findings & Conclusion:**
    *   The `EmployeeSalary` type definition is:
        ```typescript
        export interface EmployeeSalary {
          id: string;
          name: string;
          salesAmount?: number;
          baseSalary: number;
          commission: number;
          bonus: number;
          targetBonus?: number;
          deductions: number;
          loans: number;
          total: number; // This will map to net_salary_paid
          calculationError?: string;
        }
        ```
    *   The mapping to the `employee_monthly_salary` table will be as follows:
        *   `base_salary` (DB) from `EmployeeSalary.baseSalary`.
        *   `sales_amount` (DB) from `EmployeeSalary.salesAmount` (or 0).
        *   `commission_amount` (DB) from `EmployeeSalary.commission`.
        *   `total_bonuses` (DB) will be calculated as `(EmployeeSalary.bonus || 0) + (EmployeeSalary.targetBonus || 0)`. This assumes these are the sole components of total bonuses within `EmployeeSalary`.
        *   `total_deductions` (DB) will be taken directly from `EmployeeSalary.deductions`. This assumes `EmployeeSalary.deductions` is a comprehensive sum.
        *   `total_loan_repayments` (DB) will be taken directly from `EmployeeSalary.loans`. This assumes `EmployeeSalary.loans` is a comprehensive sum.
        *   `net_salary_paid` (DB) from `EmployeeSalary.total`.
    *   The `calculation_details_json` field in the database will store the stringified `EmployeeSalary` object, providing a full audit trail of the frontend-calculated values.
    *   No changes were required for the `EmployeeSalary` type itself for this phase, aligning with the directive not to alter existing calculation logic. The type is deemed adequate for snapshotting.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING: This is only a review task. DO NOT modify how the existing salary calculation works.** (Adhered to)
> üìù **After Completion:** Update the plan to mark this sub-task as complete and update the overall progress. (Completed)

### Phase 2: Frontend - Updating Payment Confirmation Logic (100% Complete)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING: DO NOT MODIFY ANY SALARY CALCULATION LOGIC**
> This phase focuses on storing the already-calculated salary data, not changing how it's calculated.
> The `useSalaryData` hook and calculators in `/src/lib/salary` must remain untouched.

#### Sub-Task 2.1.1: Modify Payment Confirmation Data Gathering & Processing (100% Complete)
*   **File:** `src/components/admin/employee-management/salary/components/SalaryTable.tsx`.
*   **Function Modified:** `handlePaymentConfirm` function was successfully updated to properly format and store salary data.
*   **Implemented:** 
    - Improved validation to check for NaN values in salary data
    - Added comprehensive logging for debugging
    - Structured data mapping from EmployeeSalary to database fields
    - Fixed date formatting for consistent storage
    - Added salary plan name retrieval from the available plans

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING: No salary calculation logic was changed - only snapshotting the values calculated by `useSalaryData`**

#### Sub-Task 2.1.2: Update Supabase Insert Call (100% Complete)
*   **File:** `src/components/admin/employee-management/salary/components/SalaryTable.tsx`
*   **Implemented:** 
    - Successfully updated Supabase call to insert data into the new `employee_monthly_salary` table
    - Implemented a simplified approach that treats the table name as a string rather than requiring TypeScript to recognize it as a database type
    - Added comprehensive error handling and logging
    - Fixed the promise chain to properly return success/failure to the PaymentConfirmation component

#### Sub-Task 2.1.3: Fix Event Propagation Issues in PaymentConfirmation (100% Complete)
*   **File:** `src/components/admin/employee-management/salary/PaymentConfirmation.tsx`
*   **Issue Resolved:** Fixed event propagation issues where clicking elements within the dialog (especially calendar controls) would bubble up and trigger unwanted actions.
*   **Implementation:**
    - Added preventPropagation handlers to critical elements
    - Improved click handlers to explicitly stop propagation
    - Fixed calendar component interactions to prevent navigation triggers when using date picker
    - Ensured both mobile and desktop implementations work correctly

---
### **Troubleshooting Resolution**

The payment confirmation functionality is now working correctly. Issues were resolved by:

1. **Simplified Database Approach:**
   - Using the raw table name 'employee_monthly_salary' rather than requiring TypeScript to recognize it as a database type
   - Reducing nested try-catch complexity in favor of a more direct approach

2. **Event Propagation Fixes:**
   - Added proper event stopping in the PaymentConfirmation dialog
   - Fixed calendar component interaction issues
   - Ensured dialog interactions don't bubble up to parent components

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Added comprehensive logging throughout the payment confirmation flow
   - Improved error catching and feedback
   - Fixed loading state management

4. **Data Formatting:**
   - Implemented consistent date formatting
   - Added proper null checks for optional fields

**Next Steps:**

The remaining work focuses on implementing the Salary History tab to display the payment records:

This detailed plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for implementing the new salary payment confirmation and history system. Remember to replace placeholder values (like `'your_actual_admin_auth_user_id'`) with actual project-specific configurations.
The review of the `EmployeeSalary` type (Sub-Task 1.1.5) is critical to ensure the accuracy of the stored snapshots.
