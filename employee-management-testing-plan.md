## Phase 1: Cross-Device Testing (In Progress)

### Task 1.1: Visual Testing

**Goal**: Ensure consistent visual appearance across all devices and browsers.

**Test Cases**:
- [ ] Navigation tabs render correctly and are scrollable on all devices
- [ ] Employee cards stack properly and maintain proper spacing
- [ ] SalaryDashboard stat cards scroll horizontally without issues
- [ ] Modals and bottom sheets appear correctly from all entry points
- [ ] Touch targets (buttons, links) are appropriately sized (minimum 44Ã—44px)
- [ ] Text remains legible at all viewport sizes
- [ ] No horizontal overflow causing page-wide scrolling
- [ ] Responsive layout breakpoints trigger correctly across devices

**Priority Components**:
1. EmployeeTab.tsx
2. EmployeeCard.tsx
3. SalaryDashboard.tsx
4. SalaryBreakdown.tsx
5. ScheduleDisplay.tsx

### Task 1.2: Interaction Testing

**Goal**: Verify touch interactions work smoothly across all devices.

**Test Cases**:
- [ ] Horizontal scrolling in stat cards works with touch gestures
- [ ] Tab navigation is functional with proper active state indication
- [ ] Bottom sheets open and close correctly with touch gestures
- [ ] Expandable sections (show/hide details) work properly
- [ ] Employee card selection opens detailed view correctly
- [ ] Button presses register properly with appropriate visual feedback
- [ ] Modals can be dismissed with standard touch patterns
- [ ] Form inputs (search, filters) are easily accessible and functional

### Task 1.3: Orientation Testing

**Goal**: Ensure UI adapts correctly to both portrait and landscape orientations.

**Test Cases**:
- [ ] SalaryDashboard adapts properly to landscape mode
- [ ] EmployeeCards maintain proper layout in landscape
- [ ] Bottom sheets adjust height appropriately in landscape
- [ ] Text remains readable without horizontal scrolling in landscape
- [ ] Action buttons remain accessible in both orientations
- [ ] Tables/grids adjust column count appropriately

## Phase 2: Performance Optimization (In Progress)

### Task 2.1: Loading Performance Analysis

**Goal**: Identify and address initial load bottlenecks.

**Test Cases**:
- [ ] Measure Time to Interactive (TTI) for SalaryDashboard
- [ ] Measure First Contentful Paint (FCP) for employee list
- [ ] Analyze render blocking resources
- [ ] Identify components with unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Evaluate image loading performance for employee photos
- [ ] Test skeleton loading states on slow networks

**Initial Findings**:
- SalaryDashboard initial load takes 1.2s on iPhone SE (slow 4G)
- Employee photo loading causes layout shift on Android devices
- SalaryBreakdown.tsx bottom sheet has slow animation on older devices

### Task 2.2: Rendering Optimization

**Goal**: Improve rendering performance, especially for scrolling interactions.

**Test Cases**:
- [ ] Analyze paint time during horizontal stat card scrolling
- [ ] Measure frame rates during scroll interactions
- [ ] Test for jank in list scrolling on low-end devices
- [ ] Verify smooth animations in bottom sheet transitions
- [ ] Check for performance regressions in table sorting/filtering

**Optimization Targets**:
1. SalaryDashboard.tsx horizontal scroll performance
2. EmployeeCard.tsx list rendering
3. SalaryTable.tsx filtering performance
4. Bottom sheet animations

### Task 2.3: Memory Usage Analysis

**Goal**: Ensure the application does not have memory leaks or excessive memory usage.

**Test Cases**:
- [ ] Monitor memory usage during extended browsing sessions
- [ ] Test multiple tab switches for memory leaks
- [ ] Verify proper cleanup of event listeners and subscriptions
- [ ] Measure DOM node count for potential bloat

## Phase 3: Accessibility Testing (Planned)

### Task 3.1: Screen Reader Compatibility

**Goal**: Ensure the application is usable with screen readers on mobile devices.

**Test Cases**:
- [ ] Navigation with VoiceOver (iOS) and TalkBack (Android)
- [ ] Proper focus order and announcement of interactive elements
- [ ] Verify all images have appropriate alt text
- [ ] Check that expandable sections are properly announced

### Task 3.2: Keyboard Navigation 

**Goal**: Verify keyboard navigation for accessibility.

**Test Cases**:
- [ ] Tab order is logical and follows visual layout
- [ ] Focus states are visible and persistent
- [ ] Actionable elements can be activated with keyboard
- [ ] Modal traps focus appropriately

## Phase 4: Final Adjustments (Planned)

### Task 4.1: Bug Fixes and Refinements

**Goal**: Address any issues found during testing phases.

**Known Issues to Address**:
- [ ] Touch targets overlapping in some dense UI areas
- [ ] Bottom sheet height calculation inconsistency in landscape mode
- [ ] Tab navigation scroll position reset on some device/browser combinations

### Task 4.2: Performance Tuning

**Goal**: Fine-tune performance based on test results.

**Optimization Areas**:
- [ ] Implement virtualization for long lists if needed
- [ ] Optimize image loading and caching
- [ ] Improve animation performance through hardware acceleration
- [ ] Reduce unnecessary re-renders through memoization

## Test Documentation Guidelines

For each component tested, document:

1. **Component Path**: Full path to the component file
2. **Test Devices**: List of devices tested on
3. **Issues Found**: Description of any issues found during testing
4. **Performance Metrics**: Key metrics for the component (load time, interaction time)
5. **Screenshots**: Before/after comparisons where applicable
6. **Optimization Applied**: Description of any performance optimizations implemented

## Current Testing Progress

### SalaryDashboard.tsx (src/components/admin/employee-management/salary/SalaryDashboard.tsx)

**Devices Tested**:
- iPhone SE 2020 (iOS 16.5)

**Issues Found**:
- Horizontal scrolling of stat cards shows slight jank on low-end devices
- Month selector has small touch targets in landscape mode

**Performance Metrics**:
- Initial Render: 950ms (before), 780ms (after optimizations)
- Time to Interactive: 1.2s (before), 980ms (after optimizations)
- Memory Usage: 42MB stable

**Optimizations Applied**:
- Added passive event listeners for scroll events
- Implemented shouldComponentUpdate to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Optimized stat card rendering with React.memo

### EmployeeCard.tsx (src/components/admin/employee-management/EmployeeCard.tsx)

**Devices Tested**:
- iPhone 14 (iOS 17)
- Samsung Galaxy A13 (Android 13)

**Issues Found**:
- Employee photo loading causes layout shift on initial render
- Action buttons slightly misaligned on Samsung devices

**Performance Metrics**:
- List Render (10 items): 350ms
- Interaction Response Time: <100ms (good)

**Optimizations Applied**:
- Added image placeholder dimensions to prevent layout shift
- Adjusted button alignment for better cross-device compatibility

## Next Steps

1. Complete testing on all devices in the device matrix
2. Implement performance optimizations for identified bottlenecks
3. Create comprehensive bug report for any remaining issues
4. Prepare documentation for accessibility testing
5. Schedule final review meeting with stakeholders
