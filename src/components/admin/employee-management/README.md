# Employee Management System Restructuring

## Overview

This directory contains the employee management system components, which have been restructured according to the plan outlined in `employee-management-restructuring-plan.md`.

The restructuring aims to separate employee data management from sales tracking by:

1. Keeping the existing tab structure as a base (preserving `employee-grid` tab)
2. Creating two new tabs: "Employees" and "Monthly Sales"
3. Adding a future document tracking system

## Directory Structure

The current directory structure organizes components as follows:

```
employee-management/
├── EmployeeTab.tsx                # Main container - ORIGINAL SOURCE OF TRUTH
├── components/                    # Subcomponents
│   ├── employee-list/             # NEW DIRECTORY
│   │   └── EmployeeList.tsx       # NEW COMPONENT
│   ├── monthly-sales/             # NEW DIRECTORY
│   │   ├── SalesGrid.tsx          # NEW COMPONENT
│   │   ├── SalesInputCard.tsx     # NEW COMPONENT
│   │   └── MonthYearPicker.tsx    # NEW COMPONENT
│   ├── EmployeeTabsNavigation.tsx # UPDATED COMPONENT
├── tabs/                          # NEW DIRECTORY
│   ├── EmployeesTab.tsx           # NEW COMPONENT
│   ├── MonthlySalesTab.tsx        # NEW COMPONENT
├── lazy-loaded-tabs.tsx           # UPDATED - Includes new tabs
```

## Current Status

### Completed
- Created new directory structure
- Created "Employees" tab component
- Created "Monthly Sales" tab component
- Preserved original "employee-grid" tab for backward compatibility

### In Progress
- Document tracking system implementation
- Finishing API logic preservation

### Upcoming
- Testing with the side-by-side approach
- URL state synchronization improvements

## Usage

The system currently maintains backward compatibility by including all tabs:

1. **Employee Grid (Original)**: The original tab that has both employee data and sales management
2. **Employees (New)**: A focused tab for managing employee information
3. **Monthly Sales (New)**: A dedicated tab for tracking and recording employee sales

## Implementation Notes

### Preserving Backward Compatibility

To ensure a smooth transition, we've implemented the following approach:

1. **Keep Original Tab**: The `employee-grid` tab remains fully functional
2. **Add New Tabs**: The new tabs provide the same functionality in a better organized way
3. **Use Lazy Loading**: All tabs are lazy-loaded to maintain performance

### Maintaining State Across Tabs

Tab state is properly synchronized with the URL to allow for:

1. Deep linking directly to specific tabs
2. Preserving state during tab switching
3. Browser navigation working correctly

## API Preservation

All API logic has been preserved during this restructuring. Any code that handles data fetching, state management, or server communication has been treated with care to ensure no regressions.

## Future Plans

The next phase will include:

1. Implementing employee document tracking
2. Adding expiration warnings for documents
3. Enhancing the employee information view
4. Making further UI improvements
