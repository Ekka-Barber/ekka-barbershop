# Employee Management Migration & Cleanup — PRD Master Plan

> **Migration is being restarted. All progress and completion statements have been reset.**

## 1. Executive Summary
This document details the systematic migration and removal of the Employee Management feature (and related salary/HR logic) from the main codebase. It serves as a master plan and historical record for the migration, and as a checklist for all future cleanup and refactoring work.

---

## 3. What Was Deleted from the App
- [✓] `src/components/admin/employee-management/` (entire folder)
- [✓] `src/components/admin/salary-plans/` (entire folder)
- [✓] `public/employees-supabase-TABLES.txt` (file)

---

## 4. Deep Codebase Reference Audit
- All direct imports, hooks, and subcomponents of Employee Management are contained within the above folders.
- No cross-feature imports or dependencies are expected outside these folders.
- No references to these features should remain in the main codebase (except possibly in routes, navigation, or documentation — see next steps).

---

## 5. Next Steps — Master Plan for Cleanup

### A. Codebase Cleanup (Enhanced)

#### Phase 1: Direct Reference Removal & Initial Build
- [✓] **Systematic Search & Removal:**
  - [✓] Search for and remove any routes in `src/pages/` related to employee management or salary plans
  - [✓] Remove any menu items or navigation elements in `src/components/admin/layout/` and main app components
  - [✓] Search for and remove any references in `src/constants/` (e.g., navigation arrays, feature flags)
  - [✓] Perform a global codebase search for keywords: `EmployeeManagement`, `SalaryPlans`, `employee`, `salary`, `payroll`, `staff` and review each hit
    - [✓] Removed `src/types/salaryPlan.ts` file that contained the salary plan interface used for employee management
- [✓] **Build & Fix Cycle 1:**
  - [✓] Attempt to build the application (`npm run build` or equivalent)
  - [✓] Address all build errors, focusing on import errors and direct reference issues
  - [✓] Run linters and type checkers (`npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck` or equivalents)

#### Phase 2: Type, Hook, Helper, and Service Pruning
- [✓] **Identify Unused Code related to Employee/Salary:**
  - [✓] Review `src/types/` for any remaining employee or salary types that need removal
    - [✓] Backed up and removed `src/types/payslip.ts`
    - [✓] Created a simplified `src/types/employee.ts` with only the types needed for barber booking
  - [✓] Review `src/hooks/` for hooks related to employee management
    - [✓] Backed up and removed `src/hooks/salary/useSalarySubscriptions.ts`
    - [✓] Removed empty `src/hooks/salary/` directory
  - [✓] Review `src/services/` for services related to employee management
    - [✓] Modified `src/services/employeeService.ts` to remove salary-specific fields
  - [✓] Review `src/utils/` and helper directories for employee management specific utilities
- [✓] **Build & Fix Cycle 2:**
  - [✓] Build the application
  - [✓] Address all build errors
  - [✓] Run linters and type checkers

#### Phase 3: Broader Unused Code & File Removal
- [✓] **Automated Unused File Detection:**
  - [✓] Use comprehensive searches to identify unused employee management related code
  - [✓] Manually review code folders for additional unused files
- [✓] **Remove Extra/Obsolete READMEs:**
  - [✓] Remove references to employee management in documentation
  - [✓] Remove planning documents related to removed features
  - [✓] Deleted `src/planning/employee-management-enhancement-plan.md`
- [✓] **Test Suite Cleanup:**
  - [✓] Verify no tests related to Employee Management or Salary Plan features remain
- [✓] **Configuration File Cleanup:**

- [✓] **Build & Fix Cycle 3 (Major):**
  - [✓] Build the application
  - [✓] Address all build errors
  - [✓] TypeScript checks pass without errors related to the removed features

#### Phase 4: Refactoring & Final Polish
- [✓] **Refactor Dependent Features (If Any):**
  - [✓] No direct feature dependencies on Employee Management remained
  - [✓] Employee-related code was properly refactored for barber booking
- [✓] **Final Code Review:**
  - [✓] Performed a final pass for dead code, commented-out blocks, and opportunities for cleanup
  - [✓] Verified that employee-related hooks and services only contain barber-specific functionality
  - [✓] Removed team-performance directory used for employee analytics
  - [✓] Updated package.json to remove unused dependencies
- [✓] **Run Application & Thorough Testing:**
  - [✓] Application builds successfully with `npm run build`
  - [✓] No build errors or warnings related to employee management
  - [✓] Final build verifies all non-employee management features work correctly

### B. Database & Supabase (Enhanced)

#### Phase 5: Database Schema & Supabase Cleanup
- [ ] **Database Schema Review:**
  - [ ] Identify the following tables to review/remove from Supabase:
    - `employee_bonuses` - To be reviewed for removal (Employee Management only)
    - `employee_deductions` - To be reviewed for removal (Employee Management only)
    - `employee_holidays` - To be reviewed for removal (Employee Management only)
    - `employee_loans` - To be reviewed for removal (Employee Management only)
    - `salary_plans` - To be reviewed for removal (Employee Management only)
    - `employee_sales` - To be reviewed for removal (Employee Management only)
    - `employees` - Must RETAIN (Used by barber booking system)
    - `employee_schedules` - Must RETAIN (Used by barber booking system)
  - [ ] Back up all data from tables to be removed
  - [ ] Create and test SQL script to safely remove the obsolete tables
  - [ ] Update foreign key constraints involving the tables to be removed
- [ ] **Supabase Functions, Rules & Triggers:**
  - [ ] Delete or update any Supabase Functions tied to the removed tables
  - [ ] Remove any database triggers related to employee management
  - [ ] Remove any Row-Level Security (RLS) policies for removed tables
- [ ] **TypeScript Type Updates:**
  - [ ] Create a cleaner version of the Supabase type definitions in `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`
  - [ ] Remove table type definitions for all removed tables
  - [ ] Remove enum values related to employee management that are no longer needed
- [ ] **Database Migration Script:**
  - [ ] Create and test migration scripts to be used in all environments
  - [ ] Document changes thoroughly for deployment checklist

**NOTE: As agreed, the database tables will remain in place as the database is shared with other applications. TypeScript type updates may be performed in a separate task.**

### C. Documentation (Enhanced)

#### Phase 6: Documentation & Final Wrap-Up
- [✓] **Internal Documentation:**
  - [✓] Update throughout migration in this PRD document
  - [✓] Document code removal and database changes with detailed logs
  - [✓] Document all decisions made during the migration process

### Key Migration Decisions
- The migration should preserve all barber booking functionality despite shared use of "employee" terminology
- The `employees` and `employee_schedules` tables are to be retained for barber booking
- Database schema cleanup will be performed separately after frontend code cleanup
- This comprehensive PRD serves as a historical record and guide for similar migrations

### Clean-up Policies & Agreements
- This PRD is the single source of truth for the Employee Management migration.
- Contact the original migration team before making substantial changes to any barber booking + employee related code.
- If rebuilding Employee Management, start with a new architecture and requirements gathering.
