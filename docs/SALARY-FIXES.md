# Salary Plan Issue Fixes

This document provides instructions to fix the "No calculator found for plan type: undefined" error in the salary calculation system.

## Problem Overview

The salary calculation system is failing because some employees have salary plans with undefined types, or have references to non-existent salary plans. These issues manifest as:

1. Error messages like "No calculator found for plan type: undefined"
2. Employees showing warning icons in the salary table
3. Incorrect salary calculations

## Solution

We've implemented multiple fixes to address these issues:

### Code Fixes

1. Added validation in the `useCalculator` hook to properly handle undefined plan types
2. Enhanced error display in the salary table to make errors more visible and informative
3. Improved error handling in the `useSalaryCalculation` hook to detect specific issues with salary plans

### Database Fixes

To fix the data issues in your database, run the SQL script in `src/fix-salary-plan-types.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor. This script will:

1. Update any salary plans with missing or undefined types to use a default type of 'fixed'
2. Ensure all fixed salary plans have the minimum required configuration
3. Identify employees with references to non-existent salary plans

## How to Apply the Fixes

1. **Apply Code Fixes**:
   - The code changes have already been implemented in the codebase
   - Deploy these changes to your production environment

2. **Run Database Fixes**:
   - Log in to your Supabase dashboard
   - Go to the SQL Editor
   - Copy the contents of `src/fix-salary-plan-types.sql`
   - Run the SQL script
   - Review the results to ensure data integrity

3. **Verify Fixes**:
   - After applying both code and database fixes, navigate to the Salary Management page
   - Verify that all employees have proper salary calculations with no errors
   - Check employees who previously had issues to confirm they're now working correctly

## Prevention

To prevent these issues in the future:

1. Always assign a valid salary plan type when creating new plans
2. Ensure employee salary plan assignments reference existing plans
3. Use the UI to set salary plans for employees instead of direct database manipulation
4. Regularly run validation checks on your salary plan data
